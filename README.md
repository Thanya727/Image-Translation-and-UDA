# Image-Translation-and-UDA
This project focuses on the intersection of image translation and Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA), aiming to enhance the performance of machine learning models across different domains. Image translation techniques, such as CycleGAN or CyCADA, have been employed to transform images from a source domain to a target domain without paired labels. By leveraging the power of generative models, the project aims to bridge the domain gap, enabling the trained model to generalize effectively in a target domain despite lacking labeled data. The integration of UDA principles ensures that the adapted model can achieve improved accuracy and robustness when applied to real-world scenarios with domain shifts.
